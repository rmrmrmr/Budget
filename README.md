<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Budget-App <a name="about-project"></a>

**Budget-App** is a full-stack web application developed using Ruby on Rails. It provides user authentication with login and logout functionality, allowing users to securely access their data. With Budget-App, users can add categories to organize their expenses and incomes, and then add transactions for each category to keep track of their spending. The application also features a modern and visually appealing design that enhances the user experience. The design was created by [Gregoire Vella on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gregoirevella), a highly acclaimed designer whose portfolio is showcased on Behance.
